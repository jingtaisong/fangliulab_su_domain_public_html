Original ReadMe from developers:

程序环境：PHP7.3+MYSQL5.6

Include此文件夹里config_db.php 是数据库连接文件
$sql_name   = "数据库名称";
$db_user   = "数据库账号";
$db_pass   = "数据库密码";
此信息对应写好

mysql.sql 这个是数据库文件，建立好数据库之后导入即可


后台地址是：域名/manasixvies/
初始账号admin密码admin888

How to update DB only
========================================

Host a local php webserver (e.g. MampPro)

In MampPro, set the SiteFolder to be this git directory. Then:
1. The website should be hosted at http://localhost:8888
2. The admin can be accessed at http://localhost:8888/manasixvies
3. The phpMyAdmin page to manage database can be accessed at http://localhost:8888/phpMyAdmin

If this is the first time, create database with name "fangliul_web", database user with name "fangliul_admin" and password "shanghai5487". If they need to be changed, also need to update
Include/config_db.php correspondingly. Import database from the file mysql.sql.

After modifying content using admin, export the database to a new file mysql_new.sql.

On Stanford domain dashboard, delete the database fangliul_web, re-create a database with the same name, remember to set the collation type to utf8_general_ci.
You can also try dropping all existing tables instead of deleting the database.
Import from the new file mysql_new.sql.
Test and confirm it works as expected.

In git repository, use mysql_new.sql to overwrite the old mysql.sql. Update the git repository remotely to keep records.

Then update the source code following the instruction in the next session.

How to update source code
========================================

Empty trash.
Delete all the existing files in public_html directory into trash.
Compress the git directory into a .zip file.
Upload that .zip file into public_html directory on the server.
Extract to public_html.
Move the content one level up to public_html. Now the unzipped folder is empty.
Test and confirm it works.

If it doesn't work, delete all the existing files in public_html directory permanently (not to trash).
Restore the files in trash.

If it works, empty trash. Delete the .zip file and the empty unzipped folder.
Now the public_html directory is in sync with the git directory.
